		RESULTS
		{
			default = An accurate reading of the local magnetic field is recorded.
			default = Local variations in the magnetic field are detected.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Initial scans indicate a large magnetic field surrounding Kerbin, its intensity decreases with increasing altitude.
			KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's magnetic field spans several planetary radii, protecting its atmosphere from the solar wind and cosmic radiation.
			KerbinInSpaceHigh = Interactions with the solar wind significantly distort Kerbin's magnetic field, resulting in a compressed field on Kerbin's solar side, and a tapered tail on the opposite side.
			KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The magnetometer is properly calibrated and records Kerbin's surface level magnetic field.
			KerbinSrfLanded = The magnetometer records an accurate reading of Kerbin's surface magnetic field.
			KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The magnetic field lines near the pole are almost directly vertical relative to the surface, indicating that Kerbin's magnetic poles are closely aligned with its geographic poles.
			KerbinSrfLandedMountains = A strong magnetic field suggests that you may have stumbled upon one of Kerbin's mythic "magnetic mountains".
			KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Strong local magnetic fields are detected in this area, suggesting high concentrations of magnetically active elements.
			KerbinSrfLandedRunway = For some reason the magnetic field lines are continuously changing directions; it's almost as if someone is running in circles around the runway with a giant magnet.
			KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The magnetometer provides a decent approximation of this flag pole; all that's left is to climb to the top and hang a flag.
			KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The enormous radio dishes block out Kerbin's natural magnetic field.
			KerbinSrfLandedVAB = Wouldn't it make more sense to have taken readings from the VAB before launch?
			KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = Now is this really necessary?
			KerbinSrfLandedR&D = Maybe someone else should be taking reading from the R&D center...
			KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = OK, really now, let's go somewhere interesting to take magnetometer readings...
			KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = Pointing this magnetometer at the Admin building might not make the bosses too happy.
			KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = Those astronauts sure are missing out on this grand adventure...
			KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The tower controllers are not amused...
			KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = Nothing better to do?
			KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Mission Control confirms that this is indeed a waste of time.
			MunInSpaceHigh = A weak magnetic field indicates that the Mun may once have contained a molten iron core.
			MunInSpaceLow = Localized magnetic fields are detected over several regions of the Mun's surface.
			MunSrfLanded = A very faint magnetic field is detected on the Mun's surface.
			MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = A weak magnetic field is detected in this region. The absence of large craters nearby suggests that this crustal magnetization is left over from the Mun's once molten core.
			MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = Strong magnetic fields are detected in the base of the crater, likely arising from magnetically aligned ejecta from a large impactor.
			MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = A strong magnetic field is detected in the deeper regions of this crater.
			MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = An intense magnetic field is detected in this crater, possibly originating in material from the meteorite that impacted here.
			MunSrfLandedPoles = Magnetic field strength remains at baseline levels for the Mun's surface, indicating that no further geodynamo activity occurs in the Mun's core.
			MinmusInSpace = Frozen ice cream doesn't emit a magnetic field dummy.
			MinmusSrfLanded = Closer study reveals that Minmus does indeed not generate a magnetic field.
			MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Even Minmus' minty-looking frozen surface is magnetically dead.
			MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = The readout is flat, like the frozen surface.
			SunInSpaceLow = Sensors overloading... oh dear, I think the boom is melting.
			SunInSpaceHigh = Kerbol's enormous magnetosphere extends well beyond the orbit Eeloo, affecting all of the planets in the solar system.
			MohoInSpace = Scans indicate only a weak induced magnetic field, this is most likely caused by the stream of charged particles in the solar wind flowing around Moho.
			MohoSrfLanded = Low surface level magnetic fields reflect Moho's lack of any internally generated magnetosphere.
			EveInSpaceLow = Intense magnetic fields nearly overload the sensors.
			EveInSpaceHigh = A strong magnetic field ensures that Eve's atmosphere remains protected from Kerbol's radiation.
			EveSrfLanded = Surface level magnetism is slightly lower than that measured in orbit; Eve's strong ring current may be responsible for shielding the surface from some of its magnetic field.
			GillyInSpace = Gilly appears to be nothing more than loosely held together rocks with no detectable magnetic field.
			GillySrfLanded = No magnetic field is detected on Gilly's surface.
			DunaInSpaceLow = Isolated patches of Duna's atmosphere appear to be protected by small magnetospheres.
			DunaInSpaceHigh = A very weak magnetic field indicates that Duna's core solidified long ago, allowing its atmosphere to be largely stripped away and blasting the surface with intense solar radiation.

			default = Now this looks interesting.
			default = How could this have ended up here?
			KerbinSrfLandedKSC = It's the KSC!
			KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield = This appears to be an underused airfield, possibly built as an emergency landing site for launches from the KSC.
			KerbinSrfLandedKSC2 = This appears to be some kind of prototype launch facility, possibly used for training or as an early test location.
			KerbinSrfLandedMonolith1 = Rumor is that Jeb found one of these black monoliths on the Mun and actually touched it. Could that be responsible for his unwavering (some would say foolish) bravery in the face of stupefying odds?
			KerbinSrfLandedMonolith2 = Getting a closer look at this odd black slate may prove difficult given the steep terrain where it is located.
			KerbinSrfLandedMonolith3 = This monolith seems somehow alien to Kerbin, as if it were placed here by some unseen force.
			KerbinSrfLandedUFO = This appears to be some strange kind of aircraft, possibly a research prototype. It is also emitting several forms of radiation.
			KerbinSrfLandedPyramids = These desert pyramids are one of the few examples of pre-spaceflight, surface-level Kerbal architecture.
			KerbinFlyingLowKSC = It's the KSC, from the air!
			KerbinFlyingLowIslandAirfield = From the air this looks like a nice spot for a landing; a useful alternative to the KSC airstrip.
			KerbinFlyingLowKSC2 = From the air this facility really pales in comparison with the KSC; it is lacking in various important buildings and likely provides only the bare minimum of services required for a launch.
			KerbinFlyingLowMonolith1 = A sharp spike in radio wave emissions is detected after making a close flyby over this object.
			KerbinFlyingLowMonolith2 = Nestled into the mountainside is another one of the strange black monoliths that have been reported at various locations on the surface of Kerbin.
			KerbinFlyingLowMonolith3 = Another mocking face. Who, or what, is this mysterious Squad?
			KerbinFlyingLowUFO = Some strange radio signals are detected while flying over this object. Perhaps some kind of distress signal?
			KerbinFlyingLowPyramids = Viewed from above the scale of this site becomes apparent. There remain, however, few clues about how or why these buildings were constructed.
			MunSrfLandedMonolith1 = This mysterious black slate matches the description of several objects found on Kerbin, what, or who, could be the source of such structures?
			MunSrfLandedMonolith2 = Another mocking face. Who, or what, is this mysterious Squad?
			MunSrfLandedMonolith3 = The mysterious Squad strikes again, surely they must come here for the benefit of all Kerbal-kind
			MunSrfLandedUFO = This oddly shaped spacecraft bears some resemblance to objects described in several mysterious sightings over Kerbin.
			MunSrfLandedArmstrongMemorial = It appears to be a monument of some kind, likely dedicated to a brave forerunner in the exploration of the universe.
			MunSrfLandedRockArch1 = How such a curious rock formation could be formed on the Mun, with no water or weathering action, is an intriguing question.
			MunSrfLandedRockArch2 = Another strange rock formation, this one situated in near the bottom of a crater. Perhaps it was created through some kind of impact.
			MunSrfLandedRockArch3 = Close observation shows what appears to be an extraordinary structure, made out of very ordinary rock.
			MunFlyingLowMonolith1 = A sharp spike in radio wave emissions is detected after making a close flyby over this object.
			MunFlyingLowMonolith2 = This black monolith is nearly invisible against the dark surface of the Mun, only a faint radio signal gives away its presence.
			MunFlyingLowMonolith3 = The surface of this object appears to be a nearly perfect black body absorber, reflecting nothing and showing almost no signs of its existence on any of the scanners.
			MunFlyingLowArmstrongMemorial = This stone memorial stands out amid the bleak Munscape.
			MunFlyingLowUFO = A short, repeating radio signal is detected emanating from this object.
			MunFlyingLowRockArch1 = This arch is just begging to flown through; there is certainly much valuable science to be gained by doing so.
			MunFlyingLowRockArch2 = Perhaps this structure was made as part of some elaborate obstacle course on the surface of the Mun.
			MunFlyingLowRockArch3 = Seen from above this formation almost looks as if it were simply dropped onto the surface.
			MinmusFlyingLowMonolith1 = How this object remains suspended above the surface of Minmus is as much a mystery as its origin, or the meaning of the mocking face etched into its side.
			MinmusFlyingLowMonolith1 = The surface of this object appears to be a nearly perfect black body absorber, reflecting nothing and showing almost no signs of its existence on any of the scanners.
			DunaSrfLandedFace = From the side, the optical imager shows nothing but an ordinary rock. There are however, several curious emissions causing increasing levels of distortion in the other sensors.
			DunaSrfLandedMastCamera = This curious looking instrument appears to belong to some long abandoned spacecraft.
			DunaSrfLandedMastCamera = Faint signs of radiation and electrical activity are detected from this object, a sign that it might not be completely inactive.
			DunaSrfLandedPyramid = This fascinating structure appears at first glance to be nothing more than a curious feature of Duna's surface.
			DunaSrfLandedPyramid = Close scans of this seemingly natural structure reveal a short, repeating pattern of radio emissions.
			DunaFlyingLowFace = Viewed from above the significance of this rock becomes obvious. There is no way to ignore the close resemblance to a Kerbal face.
			DunaFlyingLowMastCamera = What appears to be some kind of spacecraft instrument is jutting out of the surface here. Signs of more buried below?
			DunaFlyingLowPyramid = The precise geometry of this structure becomes more apparent when viewed from above.
			DunaFlyingLowPyramid = Perhaps the radio signals emanating from this structure contain some clue as to its origin.
			VallSrfLandedIcehenge = Visual observation shows what can't possibly be a natural phenomenon; the pattern of arrangement suggests some kind of intelligence at work.
			VallSrfLandedIcehenge = Bursts of powerful, repeating radio emissions are detected coming from these structures.
			VallFlyingLowIcehenge = The seemingly careful arrangement of these structures suggests some deeper meaning or purpose; perhaps a message of some kind?
			VallFlyingLowIcehenge = Powerful bursts of radio wave activity are detected while flying over this formation. Could this be some kind of transmitter or relay device?
			TyloSrfLandedCave = The cave looks rather cozy, almost like it's inviting you in to get comfortable and maybe stay a little while...
			TyloSrfLandedCave = When approaching this formation all of the background radio noise begins to die out, as if something is actively blocking it.
			TyloSrfLandedFace = Strong electromagnetic emissions are detected in this area, but nothing out of the ordinary is visible through the optical scanner.
			TyloFlyingLowCave = Upon visual inspection this appears to be nothing but an ordinary rock formation.
			TyloFlyingLowCave = While making a pass over the cave, all radio emissions seem to drop to zero, curious given Jool's normally high levels of background radio noise.
			TyloFlyingLowFace = The faint outlines of some kind of face-like object are visible on the surface here. Curiously, it doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to Kerbal faces.
			BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The initial visual observation is difficult to believe at first glance. Signs of extraterrestrial biological life? An explanation for the unseen, lurking menace felt by all Kerbalnauts? Some kind of elaborate hoax? Closer study is warranted...
			BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The round cleft (a mouth of some kind?) glows brightly in a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum. One can only hope that nothing will ever pry open that menacing cavity.
			BobFlyingLowDeadKraken = Observations show what can only be described as some kind of kraken, a Space Kraken if you will, lying on the surface of Bop. Dead, one can only hope...
			BopFlyingLowDeadKraken = Significant emissions of UV and X-ray radiation are detected. Observe caution when making any closer approaches to the entity.

Despite valiant efforts from their representatives, however, they haven't quite been able to shake off the bad press that followed some leaked footage of an incident involving one of their units and a small critter that one of the scientists over at R&D used to keep as a pet. Some say the incident has made them extremely concerned with the safety of anything that approach their products. They've even rounded out the edges on their company logo.

The company enjoys a well-deserved reputation for such an important contribution to the industry, and most agree that these days, almost nobody remembers the embarrassment of their recall of the FTX-1 series, which had a small but highly problematic issue, that while it did pump fluids flawlessly, it pumped them in the wrong direction.

Their first product was the very massive Mobile Processing Lab, which rumour has it was first developed as a mobile processing facility to secretly brew an experimental, possibly illegal fuel mixture, which was reportedly far more potent than the currently available propellants, and had a distinctive blue tint to it. Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.

Jeb's Junkyard has become one of Kerbin's most iconic names, becoming far more than just a beloved brand. It now stands proudly as a symbol of the unstoppable Kerbal drive towards attempting the impossible while grossly underestimating the gravity of the situation.

		description = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket engineers discovered that large flywheels were necessary to keep large ships under control. The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators. C7 has vehemently denied any involvement in all sentient-AI-related catastrophes so far.

Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.

Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere. It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

		description = The TT18-A Stability Enhancer uses ground-breaking fastening technology to significantly increase the stability of spacecraft during the pre-launch phase. While OMB Demolition has been criticized in the past for using "big fancy words for a rocket holder" in their description of their device, none can say the TT18 series doesn't deliver rock-solid clamping action, as advertised. The owner's manual strongly suggests these devices be placed on the bottommost section of the spacecraft, and activated as soon as the engines are lit, for optimal de-clamping performance.

		{
			default = You record the crew's assessment of the situation.
			KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
			KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Reporting in at the Runway. Good thing there's not a lot of air traffic, because I don't think we ever got clearance from the tower to be here.
			KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This is our Space Center here. We're home.
			KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Hey I can see my house from here, I think.
			KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = It's very comforting to see that much green below you.
			KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = You get a great view of the highlands.
			KerbinFlyingLowMountains = The mountains rise up from the ground of kerbin. They seem so much smaller from way up here.
			KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
			KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = This looks like a bad place to land.
			KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
			KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You look down and see a sheet of shining white ice. If you stare at it too long your eyes start to water.
			KerbinFlyingLowShores = The shores look inviting and you watch the waves roll in to the coast.
			KeringFlyingLowWater = From this perspective you can see the underwater topology.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Maybe if you get out and push...
			KerbinInSpace = It's very... round.
			KerbinInSpace = Crew reporting in, from space!
			MunInSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
			MunInSpace = You look at the surface of the Mun and try to find a good landing space. The inside of the craters might be the best option.
			MinmusInSpace = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
			MinmusInSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface...
			GillyInSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. You bet you could you could jetpack down there.
			MohoInSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
			EveInSpace = You can't help but notice how incredibly purple the planet is. The shiny oceans are mesmerizing.
			DunaInSpace = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles though.
			IkeInSpace = You can't help but like Ike.
			IkeInSpace = There appears to be some steep rocky slopes. The higher areas are lighter in color and the lowlands appear to be very dark gray.
			DresInSpace = Looking down you see a massive canyon on the surface. It could be several kilometers deep.
			DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown areas, with a few craters.
			JoolInSpace = You watch the flowing green storms below, they seem to go on forever endlessly swirling into eachother.
			JoolInSpace = This planet is a wholesome green color, you note down that more planets should be this color.
			LaytheInSpace = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin, you wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
			LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You mark down the landmasses in your report.
			VallInSpace = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You don't think you'd like to try and land on them.
			VallInSpace = The moon is mostly white and lighter blue shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.
			TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered then the other.
			TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. You think for a second you saw a face down there..
			BopInSpace = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
			BopInSpace = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window.. Is there something moving down there?
			PolInSpace = It looks like a really large grain of pollen. You note down -Pol- in your report.
			PolInSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.
			EelooInSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
			EelooInSpace = You search the sky for other nearby planets, you think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.

Accepting a public grant could save us from bankruptcy, but it would also put a very serious dent in the Space Program's reputation. However, the Space Program is too big to fail, so if it's either this option or closing shop, I would advise you to accept the money.
